User Authentication Microservice Written on JavaScript (Node.js And Express.js), it Serves as a Complete Backend For Web App, Providing Microservices like JSON web token, Uid Generator, Mongoose Connect, Otp Generator easy to used Service Package.
What will the students learn/ Why is the project significant?
Contributing to open source projects cultivates an awareness of how tools and languages piece together in a way that even individual projects cannot. Moreover, open source is an exercise in coordination and collaboration, building students professional skills in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.
The significance of the project highlights the value that the project outcomes may provide in the field or real-world practice in backend development using node.js. Whereas the problem statement discussed the negative consequences of not conducting the study or project, this section highlights the positive contribution of completing the study or project.

Difficulty level 
Breakdown of the components of the project based on difficulty is Medium.
Express.js is a framework of Node.js for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with JavaScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of Express, but also, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, like e.g. Moongoose, allowing for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.
Prerequisites/Skills
 JavaScript - Node.js’s environment is developed for writing JavaScript code, hence we must have an adequate understanding of the core and advanced concepts of JavaScript. These concepts include having knowledge about expressions, loops, data structures, callbacks, functions, objects, this keyword, event handlers, and other related topics. It is recommended to brush up on your JavaScript concepts before learning Node.js.
Asynchronous code
Before diving into Node.js, you need to be well aware of asynchronous code and its working. Asynchronous code or architecture means the program can do multiple tasks simultaneously without disturbing the main thread execution. JavaScript makes use of this model via callbacks. The majority of the functions in Node.js are asynchronous in nature.
CLI
Command Line Interface also known as CLI is a text-based user interface through which you can type commands to make your computer execute certain tasks. Once you are comfortable with using CLI, then you will get a hang of running nvm, npm as well as executing your Node.js projects easily.
ES6+ Syntax
Currently, for JavaScript, the ECMAScript 2015 or ES6 is the standard scripting language. ES6 is the second major revision in JavaScript which involves important features like the let and const keyword, for loops, default parameters, arrow functions, classes, and many more. Hence it is advised to be familiar with all these features.
